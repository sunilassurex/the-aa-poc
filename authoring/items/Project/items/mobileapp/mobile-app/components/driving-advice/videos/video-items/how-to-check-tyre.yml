        10
        00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,862
        If you can see part of the rim of the coin, then your tyres may be below the minimum tread depth.

        Place the gauge just above the tyre groove.
        
        14
        00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,552
        The gauge will then display how close you are to reaching the minimum tread depth.
        
        15
        00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:49,724
        Check the tread regularly at different places across the tyres so you can watch out for worn tyres and any early signs of uneven wear.

        9
        00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,931
        To do this, simply place a £0.20p coin in your tread grooves.
        
        10
        00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,862
        If you can see part of the rim of the coin, then your tyres may be below the minimum tread depth.
        
        11
        00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,931
        And you may need to check the tread depth gauge.
        
        12
        00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,862
        These come in many different forms and you can easily get them online.
        
        13
        00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:37,966
        Place the gauge just above the tyre groove.
        
        14
        00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,552
        The gauge will then display how close you are to reaching the minimum tread depth.
        
        15
        00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:49,724
        Check the tread regularly at different places across the tyres so you can watch out for worn tyres and any early signs of uneven wear.

        00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,552
        Your tyres are the only part of the vehicle that's in contact with the road.
        
        2
        00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:06,552
        So the condition of your tyres is key to your safety.
        
        3
        00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,724
        Some tyres have tread wear indicators.
        
        4
        00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:11,103
        These are small bars about five millimetres wide.
        
        5
        00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:14,379
        If the tyre tread is level with the top of the wear indicator
        
        6
        00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:17,655
        it means your tyres have reached the legal limit of 1.6mm.
        
        7
        00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:20,379
        When tyres have worn to this level, they need to be replaced.
        
        8
        00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:23,655
        You can also use a 20p coin to check your tyre’s tread depth.
        
        9
        00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,931

        10
        00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,862
        If you can see part of the rim of the coin, then your tyres may be below the minimum tread depth.
        
        11
        00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,931
        And you may need to check the tread depth gauge.
        
        12
        00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,862
        These come in many different forms and you can easily get them online.
        
        13
        00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:37,966
        Place the gauge just above the tyre groove.
        
        14
        00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,552
        The gauge will then display how close you are to reaching the minimum tread depth.
        
        15
        00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:49,724
        Check the tread regularly at different places across the tyres so you can watch out for worn tyres and any early signs of uneven wear.
