        00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,621
        Make sure your engine is cold
        
        2
        00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,552
        and your vehicle is parked on level ground.
        
        3
        00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:06,207
        Wait 5 to 10 minute if you've just driven your vehicle
        
        4
        00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,517
        and never check your oil with your engine running.
        
        5
        00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,897
        Open your bonnet and locate your dipstick.

        00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,310
        Unknown
        This is normally a brightly coloured handle.
        
        7
        00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,724
        Once you’ve found the dipstick, pull it out and wipe it clean with kitchen towel.
        
        8
        00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:22,172
        When checking the oil dipstick, you'll find two notches on the dipstick itself.
        
        9
        00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,241
        This is for the minimum and maximum levels.
        
        10
        00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,000
        Put the dipstick back in to tube and push it all the way in.
        
        11
        00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,448
        Then pull it back out and see where the oil line is on the dipstick.
        
        12
        00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,241
        If it's between the minimum and maximum mark,
        
        13
        00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,655
        the level is absolutely fine.
        
        14
        00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:33,931
        If it's
        
        15
        00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,345
        below the halfway level or towards minimum mark.
        
        16
        00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,966
        This means you need to add more oil.
        
        17
        00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,517
        Your vehicle's handbook will tell you what type of oil your vehicle takes.
        
        18
        00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:42,138
        And if you can't
        
        19
        00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,586
        locate your vehicle's handbook, you can normally find this information online.
        
        20
        00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,241
        And there you have it. That's how to check your oil.

        00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,621
        Make sure your engine is cold
        
        2
        00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,552
        and your vehicle is parked on level ground.
        
        3
        00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:06,207
        Wait 5 to 10 minute if you've just driven your vehicle
        
        4
        00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,517
        and never check your oil with your engine running.
        
        5
        00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,897
        Open your bonnet and locate your dipstick.

        00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,310
        Unknown
        This is normally a brightly coloured handle.
        
        7
        00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,724
        Once you’ve found the dipstick, pull it out and wipe it clean with kitchen towel.
        
        8
        00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:22,172
        When checking the oil dipstick, you'll find two notches on the dipstick itself.
        
        9
        00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,241
        This is for the minimum and maximum levels.
        
        10
        00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,000
        Put the dipstick back in to tube and push it all the way in.
        
        11
        00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,448
        Then pull it back out and see where the oil line is on the dipstick.
        
        12
        00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,241
        If it's between the minimum and maximum mark,
        
        13
        00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,655
        the level is absolutely fine.
        
        14
        00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:33,931
        If it's
        
        15
        00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,345
        below the halfway level or towards minimum mark.
        
        16
        00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,966
        This means you need to add more oil.
        
        17
        00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,517
        Your vehicle's handbook will tell you what type of oil your vehicle takes.
        
        18
        00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:42,138
        And if you can't
        
        19
        00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,586
        locate your vehicle's handbook, you can normally find this information online.
        
        20
        00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,241
        And there you have it. That's how to check your oil.

        00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,621
        Make sure your engine is cold
        
        2
        00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,552
        and your vehicle is parked on level ground.
        
        3
        00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:06,207
        Wait 5 to 10 minute if you've just driven your vehicle
        
        4
        00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,517
        and never check your oil with your engine running.
        
        5
        00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,897
        Open your bonnet and locate your dipstick.

        00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,310
        Unknown
        This is normally a brightly coloured handle.
        
        7
        00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,724
        Once you’ve found the dipstick, pull it out and wipe it clean with kitchen towel.
        
        8
        00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:22,172
        When checking the oil dipstick, you'll find two notches on the dipstick itself.
        
        9
        00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,241
        This is for the minimum and maximum levels.
        
        10
        00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,000
        Put the dipstick back in to tube and push it all the way in.
        
        11
        00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:30,448
        Then pull it back out and see where the oil line is on the dipstick.
        
        12
        00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,241
        If it's between the minimum and maximum mark,
        
        13
        00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,655
        the level is absolutely fine.
        
        14
        00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:33,931
        If it's
        
        15
        00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,345
        below the halfway level or towards minimum mark.
        
        16
        00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,966
        This means you need to add more oil.
        
        17
        00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,517
        Your vehicle's handbook will tell you what type of oil your vehicle takes.
        
        18
        00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:42,138
        And if you can't
        
        19
        00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,586
        locate your vehicle's handbook, you can normally find this information online.
        
        20
        00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:48,241
        And there you have it. That's how to check your oil.
