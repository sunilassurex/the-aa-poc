        Our patrol’s estimated time of arrival may change, but we’ll send you an updated arrival time if this happens.
        
        **Track or cancel your rescue**
        
        Go to Rescue, where you’ll be able to track when help will arrive, or cancel your rescue if it’s no longer needed.
        
        **Provide an update after reporting**
        
        If you’ve moved your vehicle, want to give us extra details to help us find you, or need to rearrange your rescue, [contact us]({contactUsCTA}).

        We do our best to arrive by the estimated arrival time, and the patrol will get to you as soon as they can.
        
        However, their arrival time might change for a few different reasons which can be outside of their control. For example, being redirected to help another member in a vulnerable situation, their previous rescue taking more (or less) time than expected or getting caught in traffic on the way to you.
        
        You'll get a call from the patrol when they’re on the way, and you can check for live updates on where they are.
