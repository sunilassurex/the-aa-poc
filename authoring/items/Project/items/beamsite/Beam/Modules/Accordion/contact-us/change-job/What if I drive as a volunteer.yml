        <p>Due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, some drivers have signed up with voluntary organisations to help people who can't leave their homes. If this is you, you might be wondering if your insurance is still valid.</p>
        <p>If you're using your car for voluntary purposes to transport medicines or groceries to help others impacted by coronavirus, your cover won't be affected.</p>
        <p>If you've become an NHS Volunteer Responder, your car will also be covered for community response, patient transport and NHS transport volunteering.</p>
        <p>You don't need to contact us either to update your policy or extend your cover.</p>
