        <h2>Can I drive abroad with my car insurance?</h2>
        <p>AA Car Insurance provides the same cover you get in the UK in any EU country for up to 90 days in a year. So as a comprehensive policyholder, you have comprehensive cover when you drive within the EU.</p>
        <p>Depending on your insurer, and for an additional premium, you may be able to extend the 90-day period, and be insured in countries outside the EU.</p>
        <p>See our advice page for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=515B0F7026CA48AF98071E389D2F25E5&amp;_z=z">driving abroad in Europe</a>.</p>
