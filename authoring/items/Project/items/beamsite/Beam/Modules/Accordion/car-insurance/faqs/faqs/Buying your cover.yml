        <h2>Can I get motor insurance that starts right now?</h2>
        <p>Yes. When you buy online or over the phone your car insurance can start immediately.</p>
        <p>You'll need a credit or debit card to pay either the full premium or an initial deposit if paying by monthly instalments.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>If I don't buy straight away, how long is my quote valid for?</h2>
        <p>You can future date your quote by up to 60 days. The quoted price remains valid as long as your details remain unchanged.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Do AA Members get a discount on car insurance?</h2>
        <p>When you get a quote online, confirm that you are an AA Member. You could get a discount when you insure your car with us for the first time, and on subsequent renewals if you remain an AA Member.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>My car has modifications &ndash; will they affect my insurance quote?</h2>
        <p>If your car has been modified we can give you an online quote for a maximum of two modifications from the following list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alloy Wheels.</li>
            <li>Front Spoiler or Air Dam.</li>
            <li>Locking Wheel Nuts.</li>
            <li>Rear Roof Spoiler.</li>
            <li>Rear Spoiler or Aerofoil.</li>
            <li>Bull Bars.</li>
            <li>Dual Control.</li>
            <li>Hand Controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modifications will affect the quote price, as they present a higher risk than original components.</p>
        <p>If your car has more than two modifications, or the modification isn't listed, please call us on <strong>0800 197 7178</strong> &ndash; we may still be able to give you a quote.</p>

        <h2>My car has modifications &ndash; will they affect my insurance quote?</h2>
        <p>A vehicle modification is a change to its original specification. This excludes added optional features when the vehicle was purchased from the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Tow bars and parking sensors are not modifications.</p>
        <p>If your car has been modified we can give you an online quote for a maximum of 3 modifications from the following list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alloy wheels</li>
            <li>Front spoiler or air dam</li>
            <li>Locking wheel nuts</li>
            <li>Rear roof spoiler</li>
            <li>Rear spoiler or aerofoil</li>
            <li>Bull bars</li>
            <li>Dual control</li>
            <li>Hand controls</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modifications can increase the premium, as they present a higher risk than original components.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, if your car has more than 3 modifications, or the modification isn't listed, we won't be able to give you a quote.</p>
