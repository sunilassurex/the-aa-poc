        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where can I find proof of my no claims discount?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Your no claims discount is recorded on page 3 of your renewal invitation, or it's on your cancellation letter if you cancelled your policy before the renewal date. Allow up to 7 working days for your cancellation letter to arrive after you cancelled your policy. We can't issue an official letter as proof of your no claim discount until after your policy has ended.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I pay by monthly instalments. What happens if I cancel my policy?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The final instalment is normally due the day before your policy expires, as payments are made in arrears. If you cancelled your Direct Debit before the last payment has been collected, contact our instalments team directly on <strong>0330 041 3690</strong>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Does cancelling my car insurance or the renewal also cancel my AA breakdown cover, if I have any?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If you&rsquo;ve added the optional extras for AA Breakdown: Roadside or AA Breakdown: Roadside and National Recovery, they&rsquo;ll be cancelled if you cancel or don&rsquo;t renew your BEAM car insurance policy. If you have separate AA breakdown cover it won&rsquo;t be affected by changes to your BEAM car insurance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If you want to discuss your breakdown cover renewal, call the AA Membership team direct on <strong>0343 316 4444</strong>.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My policy isn't due for renewal but my details or the vehicle has changed.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>What happens to any AA breakdown cover&nbsp;<strong>if I don't renew or cancel my BEAM car insurance</strong>?</strong></p>
        <p>Any&nbsp;AA breakdown optional extras you took out when you bought your BEAM car insurance will be cancelled if you stop your policy. Any AA breakdown cover you took out separately to your BEAM car insurance won&rsquo;t be affected.</p>
        <p>Call the AA Membership team on&nbsp;<strong>0343 316 4444&nbsp;</strong>if you want to talk about breakdown cover.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>I want to&nbsp;cancel my policy and I<strong>&nbsp;pay monthly. What do I do?&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
        <p>As payments are made in arrears, the final instalment is usually due the day before your policy ends. It's best to wait for this to be collected before you cancel any Direct Debit. If you have cancelled this before the last payment has been taken, call our instalments team on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3690</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How do I stop the automatic renewal of my BEAM car insurance policy?</strong></p>
        <p>Fill in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aabeam.co.uk/contact-us/stop-auto-renew">cancel automatic renewal form</a>&nbsp;to opt out. Or call us on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3685</strong>.</p>
        <p>After you&rsquo;ve done this, we&rsquo;ll still let you know when it&rsquo;s time to renew and what your quote is. You&rsquo;ll have to contact us to accept it and make a payment before your policy runs out, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have no insurance and be without any cover.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Where can I find proof of my no claim discount?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">You can find no claim discount details on page 3 of your renewal invitation. It's also on your cancellation letter if you've already cancelled your policy. Please allow up to 7 working days for your cancellation letter to arrive.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We can't send any proof of your no claim discount until after your policy has ended.</p>

If you have cancelled this before the last payment has been taken, call our instalments team on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3690</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Why is my cover changing?</h2>
        <p>We're always looking for ways to improve our products and services to meet your needs in the best way possible. </p>
        <p>Our new level of cover includes new features and benefits, giving you a competitively priced product that's right for you. </p>

        <a name="Whatsincluded" id="Whatsincluded"></a>
        <h2>What's included &ndash; do I have the same level of protection as before?</h2>
        <p>Your new cover closely matches your current benefits and protection, but there may be some small differences.</p>
        <p>Make sure you read the Important Notice in your renewal invitation, as this will highlight any differences between your current policy and your new one.</p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Why's my premium gone up?</h2>
        <p>You might see an increase in your premium. This is because car insurance prices, across all insurance providers, have risen due to inflation.</p>
        <p>We&rsquo;re committed to making sure that your new cover is competitively priced and offers just as much value for money as your current policy.</p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Will my no claims discount be affected?</h2>
        <p>Your no claims discount will carry over from your current policy, and will continue to be applied to your cover.</p>
        <p>You can find your number of no claims discount years on your renewal invitation.</p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Will my policy excess change?</h2>
