        <h2>Driving abroad</h2>
        <h3>Can I drive abroad with my car insurance?</h3>
        <p>You can drive anywhere in the EU, and in several other European countries, and get the same level of cover you have in the UK for up to 90 days during the 12 months of your policy.</p>
        <p>Depending on your insurer, and for an additional premium, you may be able to extend the 90-day period. You might also get cover for countries that we don't include as standard.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Do I need a car insurance Green Card?</h3>
        <p>Since 2 August 2021 you no longer require a Green Card (or International Motor Insurance Card) for travel in the EU and the EEA states.</p>
        <p>You also don't need a Green Card for Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Instead of the Green Card, your Certificate of Motor Insurance now proves you have the minimum insurance cover needed by law in the country you're visiting.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Which countries are in the EEA or the EU?</h3>
        <p>The European Economic Area includes all the European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>
        <p>The EU countries are:</p>
        <p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.</p>
