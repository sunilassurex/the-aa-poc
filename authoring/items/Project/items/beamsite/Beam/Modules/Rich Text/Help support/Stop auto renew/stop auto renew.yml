        <h2>Fill out the form to opt out of automatic renewal</h2>
        <p>Opting out of automatic renewal means you'll need to let us know if you want to stay covered beyond your next renewal date. We'll still send you a renewal invite when it's time to renew.</p>
        <p>This form is only for opting out of automatic renewal, not cancelling the policy itself. If you'd like to cancel your policy, call us instead.</p>
        <p>If you've got more than one policy with us, you'll need to complete a separate form for each one.</p>
