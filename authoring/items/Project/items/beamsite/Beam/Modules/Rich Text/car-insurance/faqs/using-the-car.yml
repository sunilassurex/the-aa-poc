        <h2>Using the car</h2>
        <h3>Am I covered for towing caravans or trailers?</h3>
        <p>When towing a caravan or trailer, you are covered for the costs you are liable to pay if you cause damage to property, or injury or death to someone.</p>
        <p>Your car insurance also covers a single-axle trailer, worth up to &pound;500 and kept in a safe and roadworthy condition, while attached to your car. For example, if you have comprehensive insurance, your trailer will also be covered on a comprehensive basis, which includes accidental damage, fire and theft.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>When do I need to select business use?</h3>
        <p>Select business use when you use your car to travel to various places in connection with your work, such as offices or factories. Business use is not required when you travel to a single permanent place of work.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>If I do voluntary work, do I need to select business use?</h3>
        <p>When you only commute to and from one permanent place of voluntary work, then select 'Social, Domestic, Pleasure &amp; Commuting' for the use of your car.</p>
        <p>If you travel to more than one place of voluntary work, our panel of insurers has agreed that 'Social, Domestic, Pleasure &amp; Commuting' is sufficient cover and should be selected.</p>
        <p>But if you transport goods or people as part of your voluntary work, then please call&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3686</strong>&nbsp;for a quote.</p>
        <p>Please note, we do not charge an administration fee if you call us to update your policy to show you now do voluntary work.</p>
        <p>Our panel of insurers operates under the statement below, issued on the Association of British Insurers website.</p>
        <p>"The insurer will insure their policyholders to carry out voluntary driving, that is, the use of a vehicle they own in connection with, or for the benefit of, charities, voluntary organisations, clubs or societies, where payment does not exceed the HMRC mileage rates in force at that time. This does not cover use for hire or reward or vehicles owned by, hired to or lent to the voluntary organisation."</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Can I drive other cars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, our comprehensive policy allows you to drive other vehicles with third-party cover, unless it's specifically excluded by your insurer. If this is excluded, we'll state this when you get a quote.&nbsp;<br />
        If you've already bought car insurance from us, check your certificate of insurance. The conditions that apply to this benefit are in your&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Car Insurance Policy Booklet</span></strong>.</p>
