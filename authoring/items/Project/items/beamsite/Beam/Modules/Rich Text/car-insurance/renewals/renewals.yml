        <h2>How do I automatically renew my policy so I'm always covered?</h2>
        <p>Check that your policy isn't already set up to renew automatically. If it is, that's great news; automatic renewal gives you peace of mind that you'll never miss your renewal date and your cover will continue uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>If you've previously opted out of renewing automatically, either when you bought your policy or at another time, then you can easily opt back in by changing your auto renewal preference. You can do this at renewal by calling us on <strong>0330 041 3685</strong>.</p>
