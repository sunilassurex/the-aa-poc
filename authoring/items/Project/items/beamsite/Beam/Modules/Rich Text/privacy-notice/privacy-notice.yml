        <h2>Transfers outside of the UK or EEA</h2>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred outside the UK or the European Economic Area, for example to service providers. If we do so, we'll make sure that safeguards are in place where required, for example contractual agreements or other legal purposes unless certain exceptions apply.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications and data, and to enforce compliance with business polices.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />

        <h3>1. To provide you with our products or services or decide whether to do so</h3>

        <p>b.&ensp;Providing your insurance policy and any other products or services held with us.</p>
        <p>c.&ensp;Communicating with you and holding records about our dealings and interactions with you, your fellow policy holders and beneficiaries.</p>

        <h2>Transfers outside of the UK or EEA</h2>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred outside the UK or the European Economic Area, for example to service providers. If we do so, we'll make sure that safeguards are in place where required, for example contractual agreements or other legal purposes unless certain exceptions apply.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications and data, and to enforce compliance with business polices.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />

        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</span></h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Changes to your data</span></h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Monitoring communications</span></h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications and data, and to enforce compliance with business polices.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Use of automated decisions</span></h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Retention of your data</span></h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Your data protection rights</span></h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Your right to object</span></h2>
        <p>You have the right to object to certain purposes for processing your personal information, in particular direct marketing and for certain reasons based on our legitimate interests. You can contact our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> to exercise your right.</p>

        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</span></h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Changes to your data</span></h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Monitoring communications</span></h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications and data, and to enforce compliance with business polices.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Use of automated decisions</span></h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Retention of your data</span></h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Your data protection rights</span></h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Your right to object</span></h2>
        <p>You have the right to object to certain purposes for processing your personal information, in particular direct marketing and for certain reasons based on our legitimate interests. You can contact our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> to exercise your right.</p>

        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2><span style="font-size: 32px;">Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</span></h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications and data, and to enforce compliance with business polices.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your right to object</h2>
        <p>You have the right to object to certain purposes for processing your personal information, in particular direct marketing and for certain reasons based on our legitimate interests. You can contact our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> to exercise your right.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Transfers outside of the UK or EEA</h2>
        <p>Your personal information may be transferred outside the UK or the European Economic Area, for example to service providers. If we do so, we'll make sure that safeguards are in place where required, for example contractual agreements or other legal purposes unless certain exceptions apply.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</li>
            <li>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</li>
            <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</li>
            <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</li>
            <li>Manage your account(s).</li>
            <li>Assess payment methods available to you.</li>
            <li>Trace and recover debts.</li>
            <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>
            <li>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</li>
            <li>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li>The right to have your personal information erased.</li>
            <li>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</li>
            <li>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</li>
            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the right to complain to the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>, which enforces data protection laws. Our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> can provide you with more details on the above rights.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your right to object</h2>
        <p>You have the right to object to certain purposes for processing your personal information, in particular direct marketing and for certain reasons based on our legitimate interests. You can contact our <a href="#DPO-contact">DPO</a> to exercise your right.</p>

        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Manage your account(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess payment methods available to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Trace and recover debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies and similar technologies (referred to here as 'cookies') are small files that hold information. The information can be about you, your device and your interaction with web pages and apps. </p>
        <p>They're placed or 'dropped' on your device when you access websites or use apps on your device. The website or app that placed them there can then retrieve the data they contain. The website or app that first dropped the cookies can also authorise other websites and apps to use them.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Cookie duration</h2>
        <p>Some cookies only exist for a short period of time and are then automatically deleted by your device. Others last for longer. These are called 'persistent cookies', and some exist for years unless manually deleted. These can be used to analyse many site visits over time or customise the content that's displayed.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>First and third-party cookies</h2>
        <p>Some cookies are set by the website or app you're visiting. These are called 'first party' cookies. Others may be set by a third party when you use a website or app. For example, they could be set by a tool built into the website, or by an advertising network that displays adverts on the site or in the app.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Our cookies</h2>
        <p>On this page, we explain how we use cookies. This applies to websites directly managed by the AA Group of companies, including BEAM, as part of Automobile Association Insurance Services Limited. Sometimes we work with partners who may use our brand look and feel on their web pages or apps. They'll have their own cookie policies and privacy notices, linked to on the web pages or apps they provide.</p>

        <p>It's important to us to tell you about how we use cookies and how you can control them. We're working to update the options we give you, so you'll have more control over which cookies to accept on your device. It's a big project which we'll introduce across our websites over time.</p>
        <p>Today, you can restrict, remove or block cookies for some areas of our websites using our consent management platform (CMP). It's provided by a third party called TrustArc. Your cookie consent settings will last for 13 months. After that, we'll ask you to confirm your cookie preferences again through the CMP.</p>
        <p>You can also use your browser settings to manage cookies. They let you restrict, remove or block tracking technologies &ndash; including cookies &ndash; at any time, for any website.

        <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies to make sure you get the best experience from your visit. They also help certain features to work better. Cookies also let us collect feedback and information about how you've used the site &ndash; so we can keep improving it for you.</p>
        <h3>The 3 types of cookie we use on our site:</h3>
        <h4>1. Required Cookies</h4>
        <p>These cookies are needed to help the site work. For example, to let you buy online. Without them you might not be able to get the information or service you've asked for. We also need them for things like recording when you see an error message. That lets us make improvements and fix bugs.</p>
        <p>You can view the required cookies we use at any time on your <a href="#cookie-preferences">Cookie Preferences</a>.</p>
        <h4><span style="font-size: 18px;">2. Functional cookies</span></h4>
        <p>We use these to see how you use the site so we can make our site better. We may also use them to give you a better experience. They help us to find areas we can improve and to collect and report on commercial data. They include analytics tools that report numbers.</p>
        <p>They also include tools that record videos of individual visits, showing things like where you click on the page, place your cursor, and where you fill in forms. This data is kept secure and we only record what's typed into forms if really necessary. The rest of the time it's not visible in the recording. We may, for example, look at how people use our website and spot a page where people don't know what to do next. We'd then use our recording tool to look at individual visitors and find out what the problem is.</p>
        <p>Other reporting tools which use cookies are the ones we use to prevent fraud and the abuse of our services.</p>
        <p>You can view the functional cookies we use or change your settings at any time by managing your <a href="#cookie-preferences">Cookie Preferences</a>.</p>
        <h4>3. Advertising cookies</h4>
        <p>We use these to share information with advertisers. We sometimes use them to understand your interests so we can show you personalised ads.</p>
        <p>Some of these cookies collect information about your online habits, like which websites you visit or searches you make online. We then use this information to make sure you see adverts that are relevant to you. We (or third parties and advertising networks on our behalf) may use them to show you ads we think you'll be interested in. You might see these across the internet, including on other sites you visit. They're based on your interaction with our website, and your browsing history.</p>
        <p>Some of these cookies are used for advertising that uses Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA). Third parties, like advertising networks, work with websites and advertisers to show you customised ads. They collect and use your web browsing activity, including: pages visited, ads clicked, searches made, and products bought or researched. These types of ads often have a blue triangle symbol in the top right-hand corner. We only collect this information if you've given us your consent through our CMP.</p>
        <p>Managing cookie preferences won't block ads being shown on our website. It'll simply stop you seeing ads that are tailored to your interests on the browser you're using.</p>
        <p>You can view the advertising cookies we use or change your settings at any time by managing your <a href="#cookie-preferences">Cookie Preferences</a>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>What about links to other websites and their cookies?</h2>
        <p>We often link to other sites to give you extra information or services. Where a third party provides these, you may leave our website by clicking through to theirs. In this case, the cookie policy set out on the third party's website will also apply. We won't control this, so you should read their policy to find out what information they collect and how they use it. </p>

        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Manage your account(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess payment methods available to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Trace and recover debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Rights in relation to automated decision making which has a legal effect, or otherwise significantly affects you.</p>

        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Manage your account(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess payment methods available to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Trace and recover debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>

        <a id="CRA"></a>
        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Manage your account(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess payment methods available to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Trace and recover debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>
        <p>You should tell us about any changes to your personal data so we can update our records. The contact details for this purpose are in your insurance documents.</p>
        <hr />
        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of the rights that individuals have under UK data protection laws. The rights don't apply in all circumstances, so your request may not always be granted, and we'll explain why at the time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to have your personal information corrected if it's inaccurate, and to have incomplete personal information completed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to object to processing of your personal information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to restrict processing of your personal information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to have your personal information erased.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to request access to your personal information and how we process it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The right to move, copy or transfer your personal information.</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Sharing with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies</h2>
        <p>To process a quote or application for insurance, we and any underwriters will perform credit, risk and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).</p>
        <p>Where you do take insurance or credit from us, we may make periodic searches to manage your account. To do this, we'll supply your personal information to CRAs and FPAs, and they'll provide information about you. This will include your credit applications, and about your financial situation and history.</p>
        <p>CRAs and FPAs will also supply to us public information (including the electoral register), and shared credit, insurance and financial history information, and fraud prevention information.</p>
        <p>We, and any underwriters for your policy, will use this information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Assess our ability to offer you our products and services, including insurance.</p>

              <p>Trace and recover debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs and FPAs while you have a relationship with us, and if necessary afterwards. We'll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts.</p>
        <p>If you borrow and don't repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs.</p>
        <p>The identities of the CRAs and FPAs are available on request, and the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods, and your data protection rights.</p>
        <p>When CRAs receive a search from us, they'll place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
        <p>If you're making a joint application, or you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we and our underwriters will link your records together. So make sure you discuss this with them before making the application. CRAs will also link your records together, and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>
        <p>We and our underwriters use FPAs such as the Motor Insurance Database, Claims Underwriting Exchange, and commercially available insurance fraud prevention services and claims services in order to prevent, detect and investigate potential fraudulent insurance policy applications and claims. We'll share information with the FPAs about your application and policies in order to do this, and this information may be given to other organisations. More details can be found in the <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/?SP_MID=14031-g&amp;SP_RID=2779500-g&amp;elqTrackId=c56eb20afefe4b47ab6bbe7b0acb938e&amp;elq=e956cef00dff4bd99421272874ea530c&amp;elqaid=14031&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=">Credit Reference Agency Information Notice</a>, which contains fraud prevention information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to your data</h2>

        <a id="monitoring"></a>
        <h2>Monitoring communications</h2>
        <p>We may monitor communications with you where permitted by law, which may include recording telephone calls to and from our business. We do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Use of automated decisions</h2>
        <p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individual has been involved. The decisions include whether to offer you a product or service, the risk of doing so, the price we'll offer, whether to offer you credit, the terms and conditions, to assess lending, insurance and business risks, and to assess what payment methods we can offer you.</p>
        <p>We may do this using data from the AA Group and AA branded companies, and underwriters. This includes product or services data (including usage of claims made).</p>
        <p>These examples explain why we do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess your creditworthiness and ability</strong> &ndash; for example if you're applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not be able to offer you credit or else do so at a higher rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts</strong> &ndash; for example if you or your beneficiaries have a history of making claims on insurance policies, or if we have concerns about the use of a policy (for example if you're in breach of its conditions) or your financial status, this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Assess the risk of fraud</strong> &ndash; if we believe there's a significant risk of fraud, based on the information available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price, or decline or cancel your policy or application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's necessary to do this when entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you. We only do so if it's authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Retention of your data</h2>
        <p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we'll hold your personal information on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we have reasonable business needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For as long as we provide products or services to you, and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
