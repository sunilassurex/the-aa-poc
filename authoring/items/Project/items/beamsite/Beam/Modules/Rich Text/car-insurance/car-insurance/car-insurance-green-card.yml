        <h2>Does BEAM cover me when driving in Europe?</h2>
        <p>As a BEAM car insurance policyholder, you'll get the same level of cover you have in the UK when you're driving in the EU (and some other European countries, too) for up to 90 days.</p>
        <p>You'll just need to take your Certificate of Motor Insurance and the log book (V5C) of the vehicle you're driving, as well as your licence.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Do I need a Green Card?</h2>
        <p>Since 2 August 2021, the Green Card (or International Motor Insurance Card) hasn't been needed when you're driving in EU and EEA states. </p>
        <p>You don't need a Green Card for Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland, either.</p>
        <p>Instead, your Certificate of Motor Insurance proves you have the insurance cover needed in the country you're visiting.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Which countries are in the EEA or the EU?</h2>
        <p>The European Economic Area includes all the European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>
        <p>The EU countries are:</p>
        <p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>What about going to and from Ireland?</h2>
        <p>The Republic of Ireland is within the territorial limit of our car insurance, so policyholders get the same level as cover there as they do in the UK all year round.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>I live abroad but also drive in the UK</h2>
        <p>Drivers of vehicles registered in an EEA country, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland who visit the UK don't need to carry a Green Card. This includes drivers in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
        <p>But if requested by the police or following an accident, you'll still need to show proof of your motor insurance. So always carry valid insurance documents when you visit the UK.</p>
        <h2>What do I need if I have AA European Breakdown Cover?</h2>
        <p>You'll still need valid car insurance if you take your car to the EEA countries, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>What if I hire a car abroad?</h2>
        <p>The insurance that comes from the rental company will cover you.</p>
        <p>If you rent a car in the UK for use in the EU, then rental company should sort the insurance for you.</p>

        <h2>Cover in Europe</h2>
        <p>As a BEAM car insurance policyholder, you'll get the same level of cover you have in the UK when you're driving in the EU (and some other European countries, too) for up to 90 days.</p>
        <p>You'll just need to take your Certificate of Motor Insurance and the log book (V5C) of the vehicle you're driving, as well as your licence.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Green Card requirements</h2>
        <p>Since 2 August 2021, the Green Card (or International Motor Insurance Card) hasn't been needed when you're driving in EU and EEA states. </p>
        <p>You don't need a Green Card for Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland, either.</p>
        <p>Instead, your Certificate of Motor Insurance proves you have the insurance cover needed in the country you're visiting.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>EEA and EU country list</h2>
        <p>The European Economic Area includes all the European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>
        <p>The EU countries are:</p>
        <p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Travel to Ireland</h2>
        <p>The Republic of Ireland is within the territorial limit of our car insurance, so policyholders get the same level as cover there as they do in the UK all year round.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Living abroad</h2>
        <p>Drivers of vehicles registered in an EEA country, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Switzerland who visit the UK don't need to carry a Green Card. This includes drivers in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
        <p>But if requested by the police or following an accident, you'll still need to show proof of your motor insurance. So always carry valid insurance documents when you visit the UK.</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Hire car insurance</h2>
        <p>The insurance that comes from the rental company will cover you.</p>
        <p>If you rent a car in the UK for use in the EU, then rental company should sort the insurance for you.</p>
