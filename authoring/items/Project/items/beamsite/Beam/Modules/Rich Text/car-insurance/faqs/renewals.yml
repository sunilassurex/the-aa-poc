        <h2>Renewals</h2>
        <h3>When will I receive my renewal quote?</h3>
        <p>Your renewal invitation quote is generated around 28 days before the renewal date.</p>
        <p>If you previously chose to receive your documents by email, they should arrive on the same day.</p>
        <p>Whereas documents sent by post may take up to 7 working days to reach you.</p>
        <p>Once you've received your renewal pack, check all the details are correct. If there are any changes you'd like to make, or if you'd like to discuss your renewal, call us on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3685</strong>. We'll be happy to help.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>When will I receive my renewal documents?</h3>
        <p>If you previously chose to receive your documents by email, they should arrive around 28 days before the renewal date. Remember to check your junk folder.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>I haven't received my renewal invite yet. Should I call you to renew?</h3>
        <p>If you're worried about your renewal, call us on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3685</strong>&nbsp;to make sure it's on its way. We usually send your renewal invite around 28 days before the renewal date.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Where can I find proof of my no claims discount?</h3>
        <p>Your no claim discount is recorded on page 3 of your renewal invitation, or it's on your cancellation letter if you cancelled your policy before the renewal date.</p>
        <p>Allow up to 7 working days for your cancellation letter to arrive after you cancelled your policy. We can't issue an official letter as proof of your no claim discount until after your policy has ended.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>I pay by monthly instalments. What happens if I cancel my policy?</h3>
        <p>The final instalment is normally due the day before your policy expires, as payments are made in arrears.</p>
        <p>If you cancelled your Direct Debit before the last payment has been collected, contact our instalments team directly on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3690</strong>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Does cancelling my car insurance or the renewal also cancel my AA breakdown cover?</h3>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve added the optional extras for AA Breakdown: Roadside or AA Breakdown: Roadside and National Recovery, they&rsquo;ll be cancelled if you cancel or don&rsquo;t renew your BEAM car insurance policy.</p>
        <p>If you have separate AA breakdown cover it won&rsquo;t affected by changes to your BEAM car insurance.</p>
        <p>If you want to discuss your breakdown cover renewal, call the AA Membership team direct on&nbsp;<strong>0343 316 4444</strong>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>My policy isn't due for renewal but my details or the vehicle has changed.</h3>
        <p>If you'd like to make a change to your policy, contact our service team on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3684</strong>. Or you can&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">email the team</span></strong>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Can I stop my insurance renewing automatically?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can opt out of the automatic renewal of your policy at any time after the purchase. When you bought your insurance, you could choose to renew the policy automatically using the same method of payment.</p>
        <p>To opt out you can either&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=CDEDD3325C8146E68C24833EE2493EC8&amp;_z=z">complete this form</a>&nbsp;or call us on&nbsp;<strong>0330 041 3685</strong>.</p>
        <p>We'll still send you a renewal invitation, but you'll need to contact us to renew your policy before it expires.</p>
        <p>It's a legal requirement to have motor insurance unless your car has been registered as off the road.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Can I opt into automatic renewal after I've bought my insurance?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, you can opt in at any time after the purchase. The automatic renewal of your policy gives you the reassurance of continuous cover.</p>
        <p>We'll send details of your renewal before the insurance expiry date, and you'll have plenty of time to contact us if you want to make a change.</p>
